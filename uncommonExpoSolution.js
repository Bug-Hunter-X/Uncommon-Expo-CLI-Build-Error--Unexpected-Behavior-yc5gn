The solution might involve several approaches depending on the exact nature of the unexpected behavior.  One common approach is to carefully review recent changes made to the project, especially modifications to the `app.json`, `package.json`, or `eas.json` files.  Another strategy is to perform a clean build of the project: `expo prebuild --clean` followed by a fresh build. If the problem persists, comparing your project's configuration files against a known working configuration might reveal discrepancies. For more complex issues, checking Expo's documentation for known bugs and updates is recommended.  In some cases, temporarily disabling certain plugins or libraries may help isolate the problem.  If the issue is tied to a specific dependency, updating or downgrading that package may resolve the error.
