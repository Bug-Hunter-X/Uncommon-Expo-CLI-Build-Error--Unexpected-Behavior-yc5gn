This error occurs when using Expo CLI and it involves unexpected behavior during the build process, potentially leading to failed builds or incorrect app functionality. The root cause is often subtle and might not be immediately apparent from the error messages themselves.  For example, a seemingly innocuous change in the project configuration, such as a minor modification to the `app.json` file, can sometimes trigger this unexpected behavior.
